            <p id="intro">
                <div>My full name is Van The Anh Nguyen. Although my background was a Pastry Chef, I resigned and chose the programming as my long-term career through the IT course at Tafe. After finishing that intensive course, I have gained certain knowledge about the C#, Python, SQL Databases, React Native and Java Script. My curiosity about how an app or a game was created led me to the decision of changing my career. I could sit in front of computer for hours to explore the languages that I learnt. I am friendly and social but when it comes to communication about work, I would like to be short and sharp to the point to make it more efficient and clearer. Listening to advises from the others is also an important part of my communication skills; that helps me improve knowledge as well as team bonding.
